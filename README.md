# qmk_firmware docker image

Unofficial docker image for [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) maintained by [jonz94](https://github.com/jonz94)

## Motivation

In brief, [the official QMK firmware docker image `qmkfm/qmk_firmware`](https://hub.docker.com/r/qmkfm/qmk_firmware) hasn't received updates since version 0.13.26 (Jul 27, 2021) and is now [deprecated](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/14230).

Therefore, I create this repository to build an up-to-date qmk_firmware docker image.
